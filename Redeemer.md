# HTB/Starting Point/Redemmer

Starting with an NMAP Scan of my target ip `nmap -sV {IP}` I got no responce by default nmap scans 1000 of the most common ports, we need to scan the rest. `$ nmap -p- -sV -v {Target-IP}` will scan all ports it might take a minute so I added -v for verbose so I can follow the scan status. That returned with an open TCP port (6379) [Task #1].

From our scan we can also see the service is Redis [Task #2].

[Task #3] is askes what kind of database is Redis after a quick google search Redis lables its self as a (In-memory
non-relational database) compared to our two options (In-memory Database) is the correct option.
In order to connect to the server lets use redis-cli [Task #4] The Command to connect is `$ redis-cli -h {Target-IP} -p 6379`

as you can see -h <hostname> and -p <port> [Task #5]

Once Connected i typed help to see what options I had. Out of the list "help <tab>' seemed the best
tabbing through my options i saw @server `help @server` listed a lot of options and reading them i found Since [Task #6] asks (Once connected to a Redis server, which command is used to obtain the information and statistics about the Redis server?) `info` fits that criteria

Lets `select 0` to select the database and `keys *` [Task #10] to show all keys within the database  followed by `get flag` and it will show our flag!
